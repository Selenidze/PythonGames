# README #

This README describes how to work with the ***PythonGames*** repository.  

Most of the code was taken from [Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 4th Edition](https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/) book.

If you are as lazy as I am and just want to copy the code from the book, please use [my script](https://github.com/Selenidze/PythonGames/blob/main/remove_unwanted/remove_unwanted.py) for removing unwanted elements from the code.

### What is this repository for? ###

- This is just a collection of games, written in python, from the great book.

### How should I work with the repository? ###

- Install the pygame library before running the code: `pip install pygame`
	
### Contribution guidelines ###

1. You won't be able to commit in the origin/master branch. Please, create a separate branch label to push your code to the repository.
2. Please, notify the owner, if you want to merge your code into the origin/master branch.
